## Introduction
Data structures are the backbone of computer science and programming. Understanding how to implement and use them efficiently is essential for solving problems, building software, and excelling in technical interviews.

This repository serves as a resource for:
- Learning how data structures work.
- Gaining insights into their real-world applications.
- Preparing for coding interviews or programming challenges.

Each data structure is implemented with:
- **Code**: Well-documented and easy-to-follow.
- **Explanations**: Small commenst on the functions and their respective implementations.
